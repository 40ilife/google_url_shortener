h2. Overview



h2. Installation

The project is hosted on rubygems.org. Getting it is simple:

pre. gem install google_url_shortener



h2. Usage


h3. Setup

You need to provide an API to use the URL shortener service. To do this set the @api_key@ class variable:

pre. Google::UrlShortener::Base.api_key = "KEY"

You can also turn on verbose logging to inspect requests made by the library. Behind the scenes the library uses "RestClient":https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client to call the API, therefore whatever you set here will be used as the RestClient log (@RestClient.log@).

pre. Google::UrlShortener::Base.log = $stdout


h3. Shorten/Expand a URL

To shorten a URL:

pre. url = Google::UrlShortener::Url.new(:long_url => "http://blog.josh-nesbitt.net")
  url.shorten! # => http://goo.gl/r5akx

To expand a URL:

pre. url = Google::UrlShortener::Url.new(:short_url => "http://goo.gl/r5akx")
  url.expand! # => http://blog.josh-nesbitt.net

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
